# Advent of Code 2023

## Description

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge where participants solve programming puzzles to unlock new challenges every day leading up to Christmas.

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenge with python.

Each day has its own directory containing the question, input files and solution code.
